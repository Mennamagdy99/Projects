    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The marketing department of a financial firm keeps records on customers, including demographic information and the type of accounts. A new product, [\"Personal Equity Plan\" (PEP)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pep.asp), was launched and advertised by mail to the firm's existing customers, and a record was kept as to whether that customer responded and bought the product. To better understand their customer base, the managers decided to use data mining techniques to build customer profiles based on the data the firm already has.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mini-Project Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply an association rule mining algorithm to discover patterns in customer behavior (you should aim to get at least 20-30 strong rules after experimenting with the algorithm's parameters).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, select the five most \"interesting\" rules and briefly write for each:\n",
    "- an explanation of the pattern and why you believe it is interesting based on the business objectives of the company;\n",
    "- any recommendations based on the discovered rule that might help the company to better understand behavior of its customers or in its marketing campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are not necessarily the top five rules you'd get from the association rules algorithm. In addition to having high support, lift and confidence, they should be rules that provide non-trivial, actionable knowledge for the given business scenario.\n",
